# Angle Class

The Angle class is a C++ program that defines a class for working with angles in degrees and minutes.

## Description

This program defines a C++ class called `Angle` to represent angles. The class provides various methods to manipulate and work with angles, such as converting angles to radians, normalizing angles within the range of 0 to 360 degrees, calculating the sine of an angle, and more.

## Features

- Default constructor to initialize an angle to 0 degrees and 0 minutes.
- Parameterized constructor to initialize an angle with specified degrees and minutes.
- Constructor with degrees only.
- Methods to initialize, input from the keyboard, and display angles.
- Conversion to radians.
- Normalization of angles within the 0-360 degree range.
- Methods to increase and decrease the angle by a specified value.
- Calculation of the sine of an angle.
- Comparison of angles.
- Conversion of angles to a string.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `definitions.cpp` file to create an executable.
3. Run the executable.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input angles and perform various operations.
